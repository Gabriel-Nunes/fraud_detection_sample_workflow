## 🏦 Detecting Fraud in Bank Transactions

This notebook demonstrates the basic development of a predictive system for detecting fraudulent bank transactions using machine learning techniques.
The project aims to simulate a realistic fraud detection basic workflow — from data preprocessing to model evaluation and interpretation.

### 🚩 Objective

The main goal of this project is to build and evaluate a machine learning model capable of identifying potentially fraudulent transactions.
Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and supervised learning, we aim to detect patterns that distinguish frauds from legitimate operations.

### 📜 Summary

#### 🛠 Data Preprocessing   

The first notebook is dedicated to data preprocessing, where we clean and prepare a syntetic dataset (simulating a real world dataset) for analysis.

#### 📊 Model Training and Evaluation   

The second notebook is dedicated to model training, where we train some machine learning models using the preprocessed dataset. We evaluate the models' performance using various metrics and techniques, and we also interpret the models' predictions to gain insights into the patterns that distinguish frauds from legitimate operations.

### Before running the notebooks

Before running the notebooks, create a virtual environment and install the dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file.

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
